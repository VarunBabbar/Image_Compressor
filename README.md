# Image_Compressor
A Deep Learning Based Image Compression Scheme developed as part of my 3rd Year Image Processing Project. Note that some of the code in the folder 'cued_sf2_lab' is taken from https://github.com/sigproc/cued_sf2_lab.

## General info  
This project is an extension to my 3rd Year Project. I developed a more efficient hyper-parameter search scheme and added Deep Learning based JPEG artefact removal. 

## Dependencies
The modules are created with:
* [PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* Python 3.7
* [Numpy 1.19.2](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [Pickle 1.0.2](https://pypi.org/project/pickle-mixin/)
 
## Running the Scripts
 Here is the expected syntax for the Encoder.py script. 
 ```
   usage: Encoder.py [-h] [--image_dir IMAGE_DIR]

   optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --image_dir IMAGE_DIR
                            Path to image (.mat file) (default: none)
 ```
 This will save the image vlc and optimum compression hyper-parameters in a mat file in the same directory as this code. This needs to be passed to the decoder.
 
 Here is the expected syntax for the Decoder.py script. 
 
 ```
 usage: Decoder.py [-h] [--model_weights MODEL_WEIGHTS]
                  [--vlc_params VLC_PARAMS] [--image_dir IMAGE_DIR]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model_weights MODEL_WEIGHTS
                        Path to Model Weights
  --vlc_params VLC_PARAMS
                        Path to VLC and Optimum Parameters
  --image_dir IMAGE_DIR
                        Path to image (.mat file) (default: none)
 ```
 
### Example usage:
 ```
 python3 Encoder.py --image_dir /Users/varunbabbar/Desktop/Flamingo.mat 
 ```
 This will save a file called 'Group_13_vlc_params.mat'. Now run:
 ```
 python3 Decoder.py --model_weights ssim_lbt_trained_DenseFuseNet_15_epochs â€”vlc_params Group_13_vlc_params.mat  --image_dir /Users/varunbabbar/Desktop/Flamingo.mat 
 ```
 This will output the final image as a mat file in the same directory as this code.
