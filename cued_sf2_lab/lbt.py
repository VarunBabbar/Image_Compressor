def pot_ii(N, s=(1+(5**0.5))/2, overlap=None):
    """
    Generates the 1-D POT transform matrices of size N

    Equivalent to the pre-filtering stage of a Type-II fast
    Lapped Orthogonal Transform (LOT-II).

    POT_II Photo Overlap Transform matrix

    Y = Pf * X pre-filters N-vector X into Y.
    X = Pr' * Y post-filters N-vector Y into X.

    Parameters:
    N (int): Size of DCT used
    s (float): Scaling factor determining the orthogonality of the transform.
    s=1 generates a LOT (Pr = Pf), otherwise 1<s<2 generates
    an LBT. The default is the Golden Ratio, (1+5^0.5)/2.
    overlap (int): Determines amount of overlap. 0<overlap<=N/2.
    Default is N/2, which implies complete overlap with the corresponding DCT

    Returns:
    Pf (np.ndarray): Prefiltering matrix
    Pr (np.ndarray): Postfiltering matrix
